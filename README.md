# json-model-decorator

A very basic convenience library for recursive JSON serialization and deserialization of (TypeScript) class instances by using [2022-03 decorator syntax](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators).
The idea is to annotate object properties as being (de-)serializable and how this should take place.
